Jowr is a little python package to make interacting with OpenCV a little nicer.

OpenCV is great, super-powerful, and feature packed, but talking to it via Python is often pretty clunky. There are also many computer vision tasks that come up over and over again, but take lots of code to implement in OpenCV. Jowr is a little library that is in the process of being made that provides some helper functions and classes to make dealing with OpenCV simpler and more convenient.

This is a work in progress...
